Horizon Online Banking Platform
Welcome to Horizon, a fully functional online banking platform that goes beyond the typical financial tracker. In this project, we will build a modern, secure, and interactive banking platform that connects to multiple bank accounts, displays real-time transactions, and allows users to transfer money to other platform users. The application features advanced functionalities such as server-side rendering (SSR), secure authentication, and a fully mobile-responsive design.

Key Features

Balance Overview: A homepage showcasing your balance, connected credit cards, and transaction history.

Bank Account Management: Connect and manage multiple banks, including viewing and filtering transaction history.

Money Transfers: Make secure transfers between users on the platform or to real bank accounts.

Secure Authentication: Utilize ultra-secure SSR authentication for safe login and actions.

Mobile-Responsive Design: The platform is fully responsive, built using Tailwind CSS for a modern UI.
